# kinase_project
Code from a side project on kinase inhibition by various molecules. This project explored using meta-learning for kinase inhibition data. In particular, how well does training on inhibition data from a variety of kinases enable performance when fine-tuning on a new kinase. The dataset for this project was proprietary and cannot be shared, but I thought the code could be interesting to post.
